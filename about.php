We started our journey in Feb 2011. We try to engage student developers, fresh graduates and professionals through our hack events & meetups. The motive is to create a local ecosystem of programmers & hackers in and around Jalandhar. The technology awareness is main goal for first few years of the group.

                    A special community called <b style="font-family: Product Sans;">WTM Jalandhar</b> has been founded for girls to bridge the gap between women who are eager to lay their hands on the latest technology. We were recognized among the Top 3 Google Developer communities of India during Google community Summit Asia 2014 held at Sri Lanka in August, 2014. To put it in a nutshell, we are a community that organizes tech talks, workshops, barcamps, Google flagship events where programmers meet to discuss and work with several Google developer resources and products. Our events are open to newbies, developers, managers and organizations who are interested in Google's technologies or use them as part of their projects.

Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.
